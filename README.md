# content-tool

This is a tool I made to help out with some day-to-day tasks at work. It has three main functions.

1. A paragraph spinner. This takes an input of 3,4 or 5 paragraphs and gives you them in all possible combinations, allowing you to easily copy and paste the output into your chosen spinning program. 

2. A wikipedia checker. By adding a list of wikipedia pages, completed with underscores to the wikichecker.py file, you're able to find out exactly when the latest edit to any of the pages occured.

3. A wikipedia edit finder. Using the Wikipedia API, this runs through a list of randomized pages (the amount can be altered) and searches each one for common grammatical errors. These are then displayed on a table for the user.
